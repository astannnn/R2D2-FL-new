## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- PyTorch

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy tqdm matplotlib
```

---

## Supported Datasets

Currently implemented:

- CIFAR-10  
- EMNIST  
- APTOS 2019 (Medical Dataset)

CIFAR-10 and EMNIST are automatically downloaded via `torchvision`.

APTOS requires manual dataset preparation.

---

## Federated Data Simulation

The framework supports realistic non-IID and noisy federated scenarios:

- Dirichlet-based data partitioning (α configurable)
- Symmetric label noise
- Asymmetric label noise
- Heterogeneous client-level corruption

Noise injection is performed after client data partitioning.

---

## Implemented Methods

### Baselines

- FedAvg
- FedProx

### Proposed Method

**R2D2-FL**, including:

#### Client-side

- Confidence-based sample selection
- Soft label correction
- Local knowledge distillation

#### Server-side

- Client-level reliability estimation
- Class-level reliability weighting
- Reliability-weighted ensemble teacher construction
- Proxy-based global distillation

---

## Configuration

All hyperparameters are defined in `config.py`.

Key parameters include:

- `NUM_CLIENTS`
- `CLIENT_FRACTION`
- `LOCAL_EPOCHS`
- `ROUNDS`
- `LR`
- `DIRICHLET_ALPHA`
- `NOISE_RATE`
- `NOISE_TYPE`
- `PROXY_SIZE`
- `SEED`
- `USE_R2D2`
- `USE_FEDPROX`

Modify `config.py` before running experiments.

---

## Running Experiments

To start training:

```bash
python main.py
```

Experiment type is controlled via:

```python
USE_R2D2 = True / False
USE_FEDPROX = True / False
```

---

## Evaluation Metrics

- Global test accuracy
- Worst-client accuracy
- Macro-F1 score (APTOS)

Results are averaged across multiple seeds for statistical stability.

---

## Reproducibility

- Fixed random seeds
- Deterministic data partitioning
- Fully configurable hyperparameters
- Logging of training rounds

---

## Summary

R2D2-FL introduces reliability-aware aggregation through proxy-based distillation.

The implementation provides a structured benchmark for evaluating robustness under:

- Non-IID data distributions
- Symmetric and asymmetric label corruption
- Client-level corruption variability
